## Deliverable 2

## 1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Dana asked to help her provide a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings based on the webpage we created earlier. She wants to provide users to ability to filter for multiple criteria selections at the same time and not only by date. She has asked to include filters such as city, state, country and shape. To do this, we will update our index.html as well as our app.js. 

## 2. Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
In addition to the date search criteria, the updated webpage will include filters for city, state, country and shapre. 
For example in this picutre we can see how the search criteria will look for the user:



## 3. Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
